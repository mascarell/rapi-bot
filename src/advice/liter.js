    "Hey, Greenhorn. Do you think my advice is useless, too?\nDon't you remember what it's like to be young?",
    "Would you clean it up, or just leave it?\nI would still clean it up.",
    "But what do you think, Greenhorn?\nIt's about their safety, not their freedom.",

    "So, how old would you like to be?\nI wanna become an old geezer.",
    "What can I do to change things up?\nI'll pack your lunch.",
    "What about you, Greenhorn? Is there any way you'd prefer to leave this world?\nSurrounded by beautiful women.",
    "And for Anis...\nSocks all strewn about?",
    "Try guessing what food I like.\n... Porridge?",
    "So I just...\nDid you sell it for a premium?"
